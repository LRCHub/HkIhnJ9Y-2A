Had a dream where I saw you
Through the windows of our old house
You were looking for somewhere to go
You were stern but enchanting
And you change quite a bit who you are
But I still see the light in your eyes
And we tried, tried to love forever
And we tried, tried to love forever

I was wrong to control you
Try to make you be like somebody else
Got to let you be just who you are
I hope you can forgive me
I hope you can let all of this go
You will find what you need in forgiveness
And we tried, tried to love forever
And we tried, tried to love forever
And we tried, tried to love forever
And we tried, tried to love forever
