Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing of when Your love came down

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing of when Your love came down

I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever

Oh, I feel like dancing
It's foolishness I know, yeah
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy like we're dancing now

I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever

I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever

Just the church
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
