I never thought that love would ever smile on me, but now I see
All the while Lady Luck was saving her brightest smile just for me
And now girl
Now that I've found you
Come closer girl
I wanna put my arms around you
I'm a lucky boy you're my pride and joy
I'm in love!

My love, my love is your love forever
I repeat now my love is your love forever

Come clouds of grey on rainy days
Nothing seems to bother me
'Cause in our love I found a Sun
That shines for me eternally

Goodbye now, goodbye loneliness
Hello hello hello hello, hello happiness
The world is ours complete with stars
I'm in love

I know my love is got to be your love forever
My love is got to be your love forever

I say goodbye goodbye goodbye loneliness
Hello hello hello hello, hello happiness
I'm a lucky boy you're my pride and joy
I'm in love!
I say the world is ours complete with stars
With in love

My love is got to be your love
My love, every repeat, my love is got to be your love forever
